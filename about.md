Hey there! I'm Bri, and this is my little corner of the internet where I dump my thoughts on whatever's bouncing around in my head.

### What to Expect

You'll find me writing about all sorts of things - current events, pop culture, AI and tech, politics, society, and honestly whatever else catches my attention. There's no set theme here, just me exploring ideas and documenting my thoughts as I figure things out.

Expect commentary on coding and tech, creative writing musings, thoughts on music and video games, plus the occasional political and cultural hot take. It's a mixed bag, but that's how my brain works.

### A Bit About Me

I'm a George Mason grad with a Computer Science degree who spent several years as a software engineer and then data scientist for the federal government. In 2024, I made the jump to the private sector where I now help fix and maintain data pipelines.

When I'm not debugging code or wrangling data, you'll find me writing, playing video games, tinkering with game development, or fumbling around with music as a fledgling hobby. I also can't help but comment on politics and cultural stuff - it's just how I'm wired.

### Let's Connect

Feel free to engage with my content on social media where I cross-post everything, or shoot me an email if you want to have a more personal conversation about any of the topics I cover.
